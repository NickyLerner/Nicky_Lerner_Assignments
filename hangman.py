# PSEUDOCODE
# make a word list for your game
# grab a random word from your list and store it as a variable
# display the hangman
# display the used letters
# display the length of the word to the user using blank spaces
# prompt the user to guess a letter
# if the guess is correct increment correct_guesses by 1
# if the guess is incorrect increment incorrect_guesses by 1 and draw the next part of the hangman
# don't allow the user to select the same letter twice
# if the incorrect_guesses is greater than 8, tell the user they lost and exit the program
# if correct_guesses is equal to the length of the word, tell the user they won
# ask if they want to play again


# Feel free to use this list of ascii art for your game
